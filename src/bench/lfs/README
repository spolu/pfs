This directory contains two files:
	1. performance.small.c
	2. performance.large.c

Both files measure file system performance and have been used to test
the basic performance of LFS (13th SOSP) and LLD (14th SOSP).

Small test the performance of the file system for small files (see description
in SOSP papers). Large thest the performance of the file system for
large files.

These program should run out of the box on SunOS4.1.3, compiled with gcc.

Large takes two arguments: the size of the file in blocks, and the block size
in bytes. Large creates a file ("test_file" in the current dir) and writes
and read on it. It does pure sequential access and random access. Random
access can be done in two ways: (1) rand is used to pick the next location
to write the next block; (2) a fixed scheme is used that jumps around in
the file.

Small takes two arguments: the number of small files, and the size of
each file in bytes. The small files are created in directories in the
current directory. Names are d0/ ... dn-1/. There is a define for the number 
of directories (n).

Modified by Stanislas Polu :
- added option to call fsync or not
- added write_test in performance.small.c
- added microsecond time printing before and after all the tests
