\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futwk}

The framework we present in this paper raise new problematics : Work
need to be done on the formalization and the acquisition of statistics
concerning file access patterns, connectivity patterns, and
propagations dynamics in the context of pFS. 

Such statistics could be exploited to elaborate flexible yet efficient
caching policies in the context of limited storage mobile devices as
described in section \ref{sec:model}. By flexible, we mean that users
and applications should be able to influence the caching policy at a
fine grain level, based on their more complete semantic knowledge of
the data pFS is handling. By efficient, we mean that the caching
policy, influenced by user and applications, should still impose that
updates are kept long enough on mobile devices to ensure their
propagation.

As stated in section \ref{sec:impl}, such statistics could also be
exploited to make efficient choice of the communication chanels to use,
given the environment in which the updates have to be propagated.

In that context, probabilistic models have yet to be designed to
provide answers to those two problematics that we have identified and
not addressed in our actual work.
