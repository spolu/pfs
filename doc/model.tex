\subsection {Existing Models}

As we are writing, new services are being introduced to the
market : they are distributed storage systems, with support for
disconnected operations. A local copy of the files is kept on every
device participating in the system. These products results in a user
experience close to what we are aiming at with pFS. Nevertheless, these
systems rely on the existence of a central server, always available,
where conflicts are detected. Figure \ref{OthModel} shows a diagram of
such existing solutions.

    {\small Existing models : cloud infrastructure with local
      caches. The circles represent high capacity devices, the
      diamond represents a mobile smartphone , and the square
      represents the cloud infrastructure always available, in charge
      of resolving conflicting updates. Black arrows represent the
      connection and update propagation patterns while the grey arrows
      represent updates made to the user data.}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Unfortunately, we believe that the need for a central server has a few
drawbacks. The end-user has to trust the company providing the cloud
infrastructure for storing \emph{all} his data. Such models might
result into closed infratstructes tighted to the storage cloud
they rely on, where compatibility or migration between different
service providers might become difficult.

\subsection {pFS Personnal Cloud Model}

It appears that mobile smartphones carried by users wherever they go,
can be used as a substitute to an always available central
infrastructure for update propagation. The connection patterns (using
WiFi or BlueTooth) between users devices and their smartphones appear
to be as frequent and efficient as the ones offered by a central
infrastructure.

Based on this observation, our main contribution, is the design of a
flexible versioning system that does not rely on the existence of a
central server, where conflicts are resolved on every devices
participating in the system. Such versioning allows update propagation
between any couple of devices participating in the system. In such
framework, users' mobile smartphones, even if considered as any other
devices by the system, become a very frequent update relay between the
users' devices. Figure \ref{PfsModel} shows a diagram of pFS model.

\begin{figure}[ht]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics [scale=0.5] {img/pfs_model}
  \caption{\label{PfsModel} {\small pFS Model : personnal
      cloud. Updates are propagated between any couple of
      devices. Especially the mobile smartphone appears as an
      efficient relay for updates.}}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We think that such personnal clouds should complement the use of
remote computing and storage clouds. Our framework is perfectly
compatible with the use of remote servers as nodes in one's personnal
cloud for providing services that are not available on conventional
devices, such as online (Web-Based) access and modification of
data. pFS also provides a solution to back-up since chances are low
for someone to loose all of its devices at the same time. Even if the
smartphone is used as a way to propagate updates, its loss does not
jeopardize the system since all the data is present on the last device
that connected with it. Finally, the goal of pFS is to provide a
distributed storage system where updates happen locally, and are
propagated asyncrhonously between every devices participating in the
system without relying exclusively on a centralized, potentially
untrusted (doubtly free) infrastructure.

\subsection {Mobile Smartphones}

In our work, we assume mobile smartphones have enough storage capacity
for holding all of a user's data. This might become true in a near
future but is certainly not today. We acknowledge this fact and leave
as future work the design of a caching policy for the smarpthones that
has to be flexible enough to leave control to applications and users,
yet ensure efficient caching of updates that are not yet propagated to
all devices in the system.
