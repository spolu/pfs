\section{Versioning}
\label{sec:vers}

\subsection{Terminology}

We denote by $sd_{d}$ a storage space of capacity $S(sd_{d})$
located on the device $d$. A group is a set of $sd$s and an
access control list:
\begin{center}
$g = (\{sd^{d}\}, \text{ACL})$
\end{center}
Note that a given device can have multiple $sd$s and that $sd$s are
not shared among different groups. But a $sd$ is provided and intended
to be used by a given user $u$. Therefore each $sd$ is given a
readable name :
\begin{center}
$\text{name}(sd) = \text{user}.\text{device}$. 
\end{center}
Moreover, Each user has a special group $me(u)$ on which he has
exclusive access:
\begin{center}
$me(u) = (\{sd^{d}\}, \text{u:rw})$
\end{center}

\subsection{Disconnected Operations}

pFS makes no assumption concerning network partitioning and
connectivity. We model connectivity as connections happening between
two $sd$s belonging to the same group and allowing all data and
metadata concerning a given ressources to be exchanged. We denote such
connection between $sd_{1}$ and $sd_{2}$ concerning ressource $f$ as
$c(sd_{1}, sd_{2}, f)$.

\subsection{Version Vector}

pFS does not maintain a versioning of the files and directories but a
versionning of the directory entries. It allows much more flexibility
to handle cases where two different ressources (e.g: a file and a
directory) have been given the same name on two different $sd$s.  pFS
associates with each file and directory a global unique identifiant
generated on creation by applying a 64-bits md5 cryptographic hash
function on the concatenation of the identifiant of the $sd$ where the
ressource is created and an incremented counter maintained on each
$sd$. A directory is therefore a list of versionned entries mapping
names to ids. To encompass the notion of file versioning, each time a
file is modified, its id is regenerated and associated entry
updated. Figure 1 shows the in-memory data structures used to
represent a directory and its versionned entries.

Each version of an entry is associated with a version vector as
defined by Parker \emph{et al.}~\cite{Parker1983} from which we
borrow the following definition replacing ``file'' by ``entry'' and
``sites'' by ``$sd$s'' :

\begin{definition}
A version vector for an entry $e$ is a sequence of $n$ pairs, where
$n$ is the number of $sd$s at which $e$ is stored. The $i$th pair
$(sd_{i}, v_{i})$ gives the index of the latest version of $e$ made at
$sd_{i}$. In other words, the $i$th vector entry counts the number
$v_{i}$ of updates to $e$ made at $sd_{i}$.
\end{definition}

When the $sd$s and their order are known or implied, we will represent a
version vector as $\langle v_{1}, ..., v_{n} \rangle$. From now on, we
will designate a versionned entry $e$ by the name it associates with
ids. When talking about entry $f$, we refer to the versionned id that
associates name $f$ with a set of ids pointing to different
ressources.

We say that a version vector $vv^{(1)}$ dominates $vv^{(2)}$ if
$\forall sd_{i}, v_{i}^{(1)} \geq v_{i}^{(2)}$. Conflicts are reliably
detected when it exists two version vectors $vv^{(1)}, vv^{(2)}$ such
that $vv^{(1)}$ does not dominate $vv^{(2)}$ and $vv^{(2)}$ does not
dominate $vv^{(1)}$. 

\subsubsection{Conflicts}

When a conflict is detected, pFS does not attempt to resolve it
automatically. It relies on concepts introduced by Gifford 
\emph{et al.}~\cite{Gifford1988} 
to provide feedback to users or applications by generating two
different file names when reading the directory for the two different
versions of the entry. When a conflict is detected for an entry $f$,
two names pointing to two different ressources are listed : 
\begin{center}
{\tt name($sd_{i}$):f} \\
{\tt name($sd_{j}$):f}
\end{center}
Where $sd_{i}$ and $sd_{j}$ are the $sd$s where
the last update happened for each version of the entry.

\subsubsection{Merge}

Merging is achieved by using the {\tt rename} system call. Once all
information from the two different versions has been inserted by the
user or an application into one of the versions of the entry,
invoking:
\begin{center} 
{\tt rename (name($sd_{j}$):f,name($sd_{i}$):f)}
\end{center}
 deletes entry version {\tt name($sd_{j}$):f} along with the
 underlying ressource and updates 
{\tt name($sd_{i}$):f}'s version vector. The underlying content of 
{\tt name($sd_{i}$):f} stay unchanged, since the actual merging
operation has to be done before calling {\tt rename}.
If the two initial version vectors where
$vv^{(i)}=(sd_{k},v_{k}^{(i)})_{k}$ and
  $vv^{(j)}=(sd_{k},v_{k}^{(j)})_{k}$, The resulting version
vector is 
\begin{center}
$vv^{(i \leftarrow j)}=(sd_{k},
max(v_{k}^{(i)},v_{k}^{(j)}) + \delta _{i}^{k})_{k}$
\end{center}
The resulting version vector dominates both original version vectors
and count one update for this merging operation for $sd_{i}$.

Hence, users are able to detect conflicts, resolve them manually or
automatically using third-party application, and merge the two
versions into a final version that supersedes them. All those
operations can be expressed through the classical file
system interface and therefore require absolutely no change to
existing terminals and utilities.

\subsubsection{Main Version}

To avoid the proliferation of entry versions, we introduce the notion
of \emph{main version}. We define an order $<_{sd_{i}}$ relative to
$sd_{i}$ over the versions of a given entry :

\begin{definition}
We say that $vv^{(1)} >_{sd_{i}} vv^{(2)}$ if the update count
relative to $sd_{i}$ is greater in $vv^{(1)}$ than it is in
$vv^{(2)}$. Or if those quantities are equals, if the total number
of updates is greater in $vv^{(1)}$ than it is in $vv^{(2)}$.
\end{definition}
 
We can always determine for each $sd$ a maximum version verctor (by
breaking the ties arbitrarly if two or more candidates are
``equals''). We call the associated entry version the main version for
that $sd$.

When multiple version of an entry named {\tt f} coexist, we display
the main version as {\tt f} and the other version as before :
\begin{center}
  {\tt f} \\
  {\tt name($sd_{i}$):f} \\
  {\tt ...}
\end{center}
Moreover pFS enforces that only the main version of an entry is
writable, the other ones being accessible read-only.
Therefore, merging process is achieved by inserting into the main
version of an entry all the information contained in another version,
and then calling :
\begin{center}
{\tt rename (name($sd_{j}$):f, f)}.
\end{center}
Under such restrictions, a $sd$ can only be the last updater of its
main version, and the total number of versions seen by a $sd$ for any
given entry is bounded by the number of $sd$s participating in the group.
{\proof
Suppose we have $k$ version vectors, $vv^{(1)},..., vv^{(k)}$ for an
entry $f$ at a given $sd$, and $n$ $sd$s, $sd_{1}, ..., sd_{n}$
participating in the group. A new version vector can only be generated
by updating an entry or merging two entry versions, and the resutling
version vector is necessarely the main version vector of the $sd$
where the update occured. Therefore, for each version vector
$vv^{(i)}$, it exists $l$ such that $sd_{l}$ has $vv^{(i)}$ as main
version vector relatively to the set $vv^{(1)},..., vv^{(k)}$. If it
exists $vv^{(i)},vv^{(j)}$ such that $sd_{l}$ has $vv^{(i)}$ and
$vv^{(j)}$ as main version vector, then one dominates the other and
$i=j$. Thus, $k \leq n$. \qed
}

Note that the set $vv^{(1)},..., vv^{(k)}$ can differ from one $sd$ to
the other if all updates are not yet propagated to all $sd$s. Table 1
shows the evolution of the version vectors associated with an
entry updated from three different $sd$s.

\subsection {${\tt pfs\_set\_entry}$}

A nice property of this versionning system is that every classical
file system operations can be represented as a call to a unique
operation {\tt pfs\_set\_entry}. The declaration of the function is as
follow:

\begin{center}
{\tt \small
\begin{verbatim}
int pfs_set_entry 
  (struct pfs_instance * pfs,
   const char * grp_id,
   const char * dir_id,
   const char * name,
   const uint8_t reclaim,
   const struct pfs_ver * ver);
\end{verbatim}
}
\end{center}

{\tt pfs\_set\_entry} adds version {\tt ver} (see Figure 1 for a declaration
of {\tt struct pfs\_ver}) to the entry {\tt name} in the directory
designated by {\tt dir\_id} in the group designated by {\tt grp\_id}.
{\tt reclaim} is used to determine wether or not ressources pointed by
versions that are dominated by {\tt ver} in entry {\tt name} should be
reclaimed or not. It is particularly usefull for the {\tt rename}
operation. Let us show a few examples of how file system operations
map to {\tt pfs\_set\_entry} operations. For clarity, we ignore the
{\tt grp\_id} and {\tt dir\_id} and only show the type of the 
{\tt ver} used :

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{open ($f$, O\_CREATE)} : \\
    generate new back storage file and $id$ \\
    {\tt pfs\_set\_entry ($f$, (FIL, $id$), 1)}

  \item \textbf{close ($f$)} when $f$ is dirty : \\
    regenerate back storage $id'$ \\
    {\tt pfs\_set\_entry ($f$, (FIL, $id'$), 1)}
    
  \item \textbf{unlink ($f$)} : \\
    {\tt pfs\_set\_entry ($f$, (DEL, 0), 1)}

  \item \textbf{rmdir ($d$)} : \\
    {\tt pfs\_set\_entry ($d$, (DEL, 0), 1)}

  \item \textbf{rename ($f_1$, $f_2$)} : \\
    {\tt pfs\_set\_entry ($f_1$, (DEL, 0), 0)} \\
    {\tt pfs\_set\_entry ($f_2$, (FIL, $id$), 1)}
\end{itemize}

We haven't shown the version vectors used here. They are generated or
incremented according to the semantics we defined previously. Note
that a deleted entry version persist in the system as being of type
{\tt DEL}. Such conservative technique is needed to handle cases where
an entry might have been deleted on one $sd$ and updated on
another. The {\tt DEL} type has to be treated as any other type of
entry by the versionning system.
