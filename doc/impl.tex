\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

We implemented pFS as a two level architecture based on the device
local file system :
\begin {itemize}
\item \textbf{back storage} : a directory on the local file system
  containing all data and metadata used and generated by pFS.
\item \textbf{libpfs} : the core functionalities of pFS related to
  versionning are implemented in libpfs which exports a POSIX file
  system interface along with a few extra functionality and rely on
  the back storage for storing all data and metadata.
\item \textbf{pfsd} : a daemon that exports pFS to the user as a file
  system using FUSE but is also responsible for propagating updates
  using any technology available. Our actual prototype propagates
  updates using the Internet and we are working on a BlueTooth based
  prototype. pfsd receives callbacks from libpfs whenever an update is
  made and has acces to {\tt pfs\_set\_entry} method for commiting
  updates to the local back storage.
\end {itemize}
