\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:impl}

pFS presents a unified file system interface on a set of devices. Each
devices replicates locally as much data as possible. The system is
composed of 4 components :
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{pFS Library}: pFS Library exports a generic file system
  API and store files, directories and versionning information in its
  back storage using the device's OS native file system.
\item \textbf{Back Storage}: a local directory containing all data and
  metadata used by pFS along with a log of all updates performed on
  this SD.
\item \textbf{FUSE stub}: stub functions calling pFS Library to
  present a conventional file system interface to the user.
\item \textbf{pFS Daemon}: a Daemon process in charge of propagating
  updates asynchronously and enforcing the eviction policy if space is
  needed. It relies on the local log written by pFS Library and stored
  in the back storage to learn about updates to propagate and use
  specific functions exported by pFS Library to update or evict local
  copies of data.
\end{itemize}
