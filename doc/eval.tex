% Focus on the evaluation of libpfs : is it really local speed
% Evaluation of PFSD depends on the technology that is intended to be used
% libpfs evaluation :
%    eval tech details / env
%    benchmark : LFS + small Write (relinking + meta_data updt) overhead
% Faster than NFS_local : Definitely usable. 
% Propagation happens asynchronously
% without the user knowing + sequentially

The actual implementation of pFS does not focus on performance. The
way pFS has been designed would be really adapted to a log-structured
file system. We believe that it is possible drastically improve the
performance by implementing pFS as a log-structured file-system.
