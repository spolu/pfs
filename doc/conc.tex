\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

We have presented pFS, a network file system that implements the
``personal clouds'' model we advocate in which each device stores a
local replica of the data. There is no primary copy of the data,
Files are accessed locally, which yields good
performances compared to classical networked file systems, and updates
are propagated asynchronously among the different \emph{replicas}. pFS
takes advantage of the physically transported devices 

% Local Variables:
% tex-main-file: "main.ltx"
% tex-command: "make;:"
% tex-dvi-view-command: "make preview;:"
% End:
