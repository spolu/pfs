\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

We have presented pFS, a network file system that implements the
``personal clouds'' model we advocate in which each device stores a
local copy of the data. There is no primary replica. files
are accessed locally, which yields good performances compared to
classical networked file systems, and updates are propagated
asynchronously among the different \emph{replicas}. pFS takes
advantage of the physically transported devices and local connectivity
to propagate updates, resulting in the same user experience as if
everything was stored in the ``cloud'', without having to rely on a
centralized infrastructure.
