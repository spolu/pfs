\begin{abstract}

pFS is a distributed storage system designed to reflect the fact that
end users have more and more different devices on which they want to
have access to their data, ranging from desktop computers, to laptop
computers and mobile smartphones.  pFS exploits a principle that
relieve users from having to be connected or to wait for communication
with a centralized system : Update locally, propagate asynchronously.
It makes no assumption on connectivity or network partitioning and
disconnected operations is the normal mode of operation. In such
system, concurrent updates to the same ressource become an issue since
we have no centralized instance to synchronize them. We introduce a
versioning system that allow to keep track of every versions of a
ressource, without global reconciliation, allowing the end users to
resolve conflicts at will.
